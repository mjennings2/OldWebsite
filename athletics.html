					<h2>Skiing</h2>
					<p>Skiing has been a strong passion since I was four. It has grown from a simple hobby to one of my two favorite sports. I spent seven years in the elite program from 2008 to 2015 racing across Ontario and training across North America. I have developed many skills including the commitment required to ski at a high level while still keeping my marks up at School. I have turned my love for skiing into a job opportunity as I am now a ski coach at my home club, Craigleith Ski Club.</p>

					<h2>Sailing</h2>
					<p>I have been sailing since I was eight years old at varying clubs including Ashbridge's Bay Yacht Club, Royal Canadian Yacht Club, and Queen City Yacht Club, eventually achieving my CANSail Level 5. Over the years, I have developed a love for both leisure sailing and racing. This love grows with every day of sailing as I make friends and gain experience.</p>
